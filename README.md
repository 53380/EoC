## Game Premise

The adventure, titled **"The Echo of Cayael – A Shattered Sky Pilgrimage,"** casts you as Cayael, a Cavalry Officer embarking on a narrative-driven journey. You start with a short inventory (Fallen Comrade’s Mask, Infantry Blade, and Meager Rations), and the interface shows your health, fatigue, and honor. The HTML file serves as the starting point for a text-based adventure with simple combat mechanics.
