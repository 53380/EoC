# Echo of Cayael (EoC)

Echo of Cayael is a small text-based adventure prototype for the "Worlds Within" project. It combines simple combat with choose-your-own-path storytelling, all running entirely in the browser.

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Locate the file `Echo of Cayeal.html`.
3. Open the file in a modern web browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) by double-clicking it or dragging it into a new tab.

No additional server setup is requiredâ€”everything runs from the single HTML file.

## Browser Support

The game has been tested in the latest versions of Chrome and Firefox. Other modern browsers with ES6 JavaScript support should work, but older browsers may not display the game correctly.
